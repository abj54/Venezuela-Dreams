  "description": "In the current economic context of Venezuela, children are starving to death and looking for food in trash bags. To solve the issue, the team plans to get donations for the children by creating an interactive web/mobile application where users can donate to a child in Venezuela, that is registered into a non-profit organization, so that the child can have 3 meals a day. Each child will have a profile and a description which will be displayed to the user. This will be achievable with as little as a $1.00 donation.",
